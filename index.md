<p>Our experience taught us that the current level of security the current web-applications contain is not sufficient enough to ensure security. This is mainly because web-developers simpy aren't aware of the risks and dangers are lurking, waiting to be exploited by hackers.</p>

# Milestones / Roadmap and Getting Involved

## Next major release features

  - Implement the MASVS Knowledge base items in the OWASP-SKF project

<!-- end list -->

  - Implement MASVS process flow under the new project section
  - Implement dynamic checklist creation for custom checklists to
    process flow under the new project section
  - Add CWE to Knowledge base items
  - Add how to pentest section per Knowledge base item (OWASP-Testing
    Guide)
  - Add internationalist feature to SKF for supporting multiple human
    languages
  - Market and brand the new AI chat-bot implementation

Check out the detailed roadmap here:

'''[Online Scrum Board](https://waffle.io/blabla1337/skf-flask) '''

## Getting Involved

Submitting a Pull Request on Guthub:

`   Fork it.`
`   Create a branch (git checkout -b my_markup)`
`   Commit your changes (git commit -am "Added Snarkdown")`
`   Push to the branch (git push origin my_markup)`
`   Check Travis status if build is still working`
`   Open a Pull Request`
`   `

One of the authors will check your sample code or knowledge-base item
and add it to the master repo.
